Python 2 Script to retrieve rates from PDF and put it into one neat Excel file

Using: https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext

My first Python Script I created to automate a mundane process! While working IT, 
and beginning to learning to code outside of my university program. I dove into 
trying Python. 

After learning enough of the syntax I made a simple script that would grab all 
the insurance rates from the Insurance Companys PDFs and put it into one Excel 
sheet making it easier for the nurses to retrieve the rates instead of shuffling 
through all of the PDFs.

The Python Script is pretty basic and doesn't do any input checking and just grabs 
data blindly and expects clean formatted input to be exactly the same everytime.

Note: This is a modified version on GitHub that excludes any specific data.
